# packaging-scripts

### WIP : Gluster packaging scripts.

This is an effort to automate the gluster package building job for Debian,
and Ubuntu.

### How it works:

* The [package.sh](scripts/package.sh) is the top level script to be triggered through a Jenkin's job.
* This will ssh from the Jenkin's slave to the machines were the packaging enviroment is set up.
* Once sshed it will trigger the scripts [generic_ubuntu_scripts.sh](scripts/generic_ubuntu_scripts.sh) in the machines to start packaging.

### To Run:

* to trigger for all flavors of Debian and Ubuntu:

```
        ./package.sh <series> <version> <release> all
```

* to trigger for a particular flavors of Distribution:

```
        ./package.sh <series> <version> <release> <distribution> <flavor>
```

### To maintain:

* For a new Flavor, we need to edit the [package.sh](scripts/package.sh) by adding the    >  \new flavor and removing the obsolete one.
